# Literature Review

The world has seen an increase in employee turnover in recent years. The rise of employee turnover is not unique to a single industry. This review focuses on patterns in employee resignations, improving employee retention, and analyzing employee turnover within an organization.

## Employee Turnover

Employee Turnover is a widely accepted method of measuring an organization's ability to retain employees. It compares the number of employees who separated from the organization to the average number of employees employed by the organization. The number of employees who separated from the organization includes voluntary and involuntary separations. This review will consider voluntary separations called employee resignations. It will not discuss involuntary separations, such as preventing layoffs or termination for inadequate performance.

## Employee Resignations

Cuadra (2022) talked about employee behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”specifically, The Great Resignation. This phenomenon included at least 40 million employee resignations in 2021. Bradison (2022) noted that there is a shift in employee separations. In a post-COVID-19 pandemic world, employees have a new set of expectations. When organizations do not meet these expectations, employees quickly find employment elsewhere.

Considering The Great Resignation, Florentine (2021) found that expectations for balance have changed. Many employees do not accept going into a physical office 40 to 50 hours a week. They need their workplace to offer more accommodating options to support their personal life and outside responsibilities. Bradison (2022) agreed that employees want better work-life balance in addition to financial incentives.

Several sources agreed that employees need more than a paycheck. Both Cuadra (2022) and Florentine (2021) mentioned that one of the top reasons employees left was that their values needed to align with the organization's. These reasons are rooted in job satisfaction. Other examples include education, training, and career growth.

While high employee turnover is not ideal, Bradison (2022) stated that it is an inevitable cycle. While organizations can aim to slow the turnover rate, there are factors outside their control. Therefore, recruiting new employees, trying to retain existing employees, and planning backfill roles will continue. However, Cuadra (2020) expressed that the time it takes recruiters to fill open positions has increased in recent years.

In addition to the adverse effects on recruiting processes, Cuadra (2022) described the negative impact on the remaining employees. Employees often build interpersonal relationships. One employee leaving affects the emotions of others. Additionally, it increases the number of tasks and stalls the career development of the remaining employees. These factors are related to job satisfaction and, therefore, may lead to more resignations.

## Employee Retention

To accommodate employees' need for balance in their lives, Florentine (2021) recommended offering remote, hybrid positions and adjustable schedules. Remote opportunities allow employees to live their lives where they want. Hybrid positions and schedules allow employees to tend to their out-of-work responsibilities.

Addressing value alignment, organizations have multiple options. First, organizations should be transparent. Garsaa (2022) found that transparency improved retention. Organizations that shared Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosures had lower turnover rates than those that did not. Florentine (2021) suggested listening to employees to establish company values.

While not the only thing employees look for, financial gain is still essential. O'Holloran (2012) looked at organizations that implemented financial incentives based on performance. These organizations saw improvements in turnover rates. Even so, this is only true if the incentives increase job satisfaction. Incentives such as commissions may be associated with lower job satisfaction. Other incentives such as bonuses and gain sharing increase job satisfaction.

Another way to improve job satisfaction is to implement robotics. Pasparakis (2023) found that implementing robotics in warehouses increased job satisfaction when a person followed the instructions of robotics and when a person instructed robotics. Employees who followed robotics received additional benefits. It improved their sense of ability to complete their task and allowed them to fulfill their tasks effectively. Furthermore, DM Fulfillment Services (2021) claimed that decreasing the time an employee spends on tedious tasks can reduce voluntary separations. A distribution center that implemented robotics saw employee turnover fall by 50%.

## Analyzing Employee Turnover

Bradison (2022) expressed the necessity of understanding turnover within an organization. Organizations need to look back at their turnover rates to understand how they could have retained employees. Monitoring employee turnover allows the recruiting process to get ahead of the turnover cycle.

Olsen (2016) reiterates that predictive analytics is relevant to understanding employee turnover. Predictive analytics answers two questions: How well will an employee perform? Will an employee resign? When an organization implements predictive analytics, it can make better decisions. For example, if a model categorized an employee as likely to quit, management knows to implement a retention strategy.

## Conclusion

Modern employees expect more from their employers. Organizations must adapt. They need to understand what their employees need. They need to analyze trends and make predictions about turnover in order to react quickly.
